summary: "Through Parts 1 and 2 of the [BA02. Bayesian Inference] episode, we looked at how the Bayesian engine sets 'prior beliefs' and tracks the trajectory of probability through 'signals' and 'silence'. Now we have the pure posterior probability P_raw calculated by the Bayesian parameters alpha and beta."

## Decision Impedance Matching

Through the previous installments of [BA02. Bayesian Inference](https://news.exavions.com/en/ba02-exa-bayesian-sales-nsbi/), we explored how the Bayesian engine tracks probability trajectories. Now, we hold in our hands the pure posterior probability $P_{raw}$ calculated by parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$.

## 1. The Pitfall of Numbers: Why 51% is Not Enough

Mathematically, 51% means 'success is more likely.' However, in the life-or-death arena of business, 51% is practically a gamble.

- <b>Situation A:</b>



$$
\alpha=0.6, \beta=0.4 \implies P = 60\%
$$



- <b>Situation B:</b>



$$
\alpha=60, \beta=40 \implies P = 60\%
$$

## 2. Total Amount of Evidence ( n ): The Critical Mass

The Exa engine uses the Bayesian posterior probability ( $P_{raw}$ ) and the total amount of evidence ( $n = \alpha + \beta$ ) as a decision-making filter.

---

Inside the engine, probability does not look like the 0–100% we know. Parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$ operate in a linear space called <b>Log-odds</b>.



$$
logit(P) = \ln\left(\frac{P}{1-P}\right) = \ln\left(\frac{\alpha}{\beta}\right)
$$



Every negotiation signal adds to this value:

- Success signals push the value up via $\Delta \alpha$.
- Failure signals and time decay ($\lambda$) pull it down via $\Delta \beta$.

## 5. Business Simulation

Final Formula:



$$
P_{out} = \frac{1}{1 + \left( \frac{\beta \cdot T}{\alpha(1-T)} \right)^k}
$$



### 5.1 Business Scenario Simulation

#### Situation 1: Below Threshold (Uncertain State)

- <b>Data:</b> $\alpha = 6.0, \beta = 4.0$ (Pure Probability
  $P_{raw} = 60\%$)

#### Calculation Process:

#### Ratio Calculation:



$$
\frac{4.0 \cdot 0.7}{6.0 \cdot 0.3} = \frac{2.8}{1.8} \approx 1.55
$$



#### Applying power of k:



$$
1.55^{10} \approx 81.3
$$



- <b>Final:</b> $P_{out} = \frac{1}{1 + 81.3} \approx$ <b>1.2%</b>

#### Situation 2: Breakthrough (Start of Decisiveness)

- <b>Data:</b> $\alpha = 7.2, \beta = 2.8$ (Pure Probability
  $P_{raw} = 72\%$)
- <b>Final Probability:</b> $P_{out} = \frac{1}{1 + 0.38} \approx$ <b>72.4%</b>

#### Situation 3: Critical Mass (Commitment Phase)

- <b>Data:</b> $\alpha = 8.5, \beta = 1.5$ (Pure Probability
  $P_{raw} = 85\%$)
- <b>Final Probability:</b> $P_{out} = \frac{1}{1 + 0.0001} \approx$ <b>99.9%</b>
