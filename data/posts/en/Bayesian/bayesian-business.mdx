In the modern business environment, decisions are made with limited information. Bayes' Theorem provides a logical framework for updating existing beliefs whenever new information becomes available.

The fundamental formula of Bayes' Theorem is:

$$P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)}$$

Here, the posterior probability [latex]P(A|B)[/latex] represents the probability of event A occurring based on the observed data B.
